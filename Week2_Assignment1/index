            <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
            <h4>[Verse 1] <br>
                You got exactly what you want<br>
                I got exactly what I wanna be<br>
                I was inspired not to cut<br>
                When you told me that you wanna see<br>
                IV tube inside my arm<br>
                I've always struggled with my honesty<br>
                But now I'm honest like I'm Abe<br>
                4 AM I'm on an odyssey<br>
                I got your beat down to the pulse<br>
                You're in the red like all the cars I see<br>
                Break new ground I blam the blunt<br>
                I get clocked like its a job to me<br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                Push your temper<br>
                Push your temper<br>
                Push your temper<br>
                Push your temper<br>
                <br>
                [Verse 2]<br>
                I got a guy and we're best friends, I hopе we get to kill ourselvеs together<br>
                Grab me by the hips and flip the switch and lose your temper<br>
                People never change but skin will rot in any weather<br>
                Come with me lets play pretend I know you'll feel great<br>
                Its not cause I don't like you, I don't wanna see your face<br>
                Bitch I do not miss you, I miss how you used to taste<br>
                Put your cigs out on my tummy smoke three packs a day<br>
                I'm just here to push your temper, put me in my grave<br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                Push your temper<br>
                Push your temper<br>
                Push your temper<br>
                Push your temper</h4>
